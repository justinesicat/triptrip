									<section id="traditions">
						  <ul>
							<li><b>Removing Shoes Indoors:</b> When entering someone’s home, traditional inns (ryokan), temples, or some
							  restaurants, it is customary to remove your shoes at the entrance. Slippers are often provided, but they
							  should be removed again when stepping onto tatami mats.</li>

							<li><b>Bowing (Ojigi):</b> Bowing is the traditional form of greeting and respect in Japan. It is used when
							  meeting someone, saying thank you, apologizing, or showing appreciation. The deeper and longer the bow, the
							  more respect it conveys.</li>

							<li><b>Quiet and Respectful Behavior in Public:</b> Speaking softly and keeping noise to a minimum is considered
							  polite, especially on public transport and in crowded areas. Avoid phone calls or loud conversations in public
							  spaces.</li>

							<li><b>Dining Etiquette and Chopstick Manners:</b> Before eating, it is polite to say “itadakimasu,” and after
							  finishing, “gochisōsama deshita.” Never stick chopsticks upright in rice or pass food directly from one pair
							  of chopsticks to another, as these actions resemble funeral rituals.</li>

							<li><b>Respecting Temples and Shrines:</b> Visitors should purify themselves at the fountain before entering by
							  rinsing their hands and mouth. Dress modestly, speak quietly, and be mindful of photography rules. Always bow
							  at the torii gate when entering or leaving a shrine.</li>

							<li><b>No Tipping Culture:</b> Tipping is not a common practice in Japan. Excellent service is part of the
							  culture, and offering a tip can be seen as awkward or disrespectful. A sincere thank you is the preferred way
							  to show appreciation.</li>

							<li><b>Punctuality:</b> Being on time is highly valued in Japanese culture. Whether for trains, business
							  meetings, or social gatherings, arriving even a few minutes late is considered impolite.</li>

							<li><b>Respect for Personal Space:</b> Physical contact such as hugs or handshakes is uncommon unless initiated
							  by locals. Maintaining personal space and avoiding direct eye contact for too long is seen as a sign of
							  politeness.</li>

									<p class="subtext">these will spark joy and connection.</p>
						  <ul>
							<li><b>Higashi Sanbin Flower Valley Cosmos Festival:</b> Every October, Shimane’s Higashi Sanbin Flower Valley
							  bursts with around 600,000 colorful cosmos flowers across 10 hectares. The festival takes place on the second
							  Sunday of October when blooms are at their peak. Visitors can also enjoy a poppy festival here in June,
							  celebrating the valley’s beauty throughout the year.</li>

							<li><b>Yushima Cat Festival:</b> Established in 2015, this feline-themed event in Tokyo’s Yushima district
							  brings local businesses and cat lovers together. Cafes serve cat-inspired dishes, shops sell themed
							  merchandise, and the local mascot “Sabu-chan” makes special appearances — all in the spirit of community and
							  fun.</li>

							<li><b>Nagasaki Kunchi Festival:</b> Celebrated annually from October 7–9, this centuries-old event honors Suwa
							  Shrine’s guardian deity. It features a spectacular blend of Japanese, Chinese, and Dutch influences, including
							  dragon dances, umbrella floats, and boat-shaped performances. Each neighborhood only participates once every
							  seven years, making every Kunchi unique.</li>

							<li><b>Takayama Autumn Festival:</b> Held every October 9–10 at Sakurayama Hachiman Shrine, this traditional
							  celebration marks the end of summer. Lanterns illuminate the town as ornate floats (yatai) parade through the
							  streets, accompanied by food stalls and performers — one of Japan’s most picturesque seasonal festivals.</li>

							<li><b>Tokyo Auto Salon:</b> Hosted every January at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, this massive automotive event
							  showcases Japan’s cutting-edge car culture, from race cars to custom builds. Open to the public, it’s a
							  paradise for car enthusiasts featuring concept vehicles, tuning exhibitions, and model showcases from major
							  brands.</li>
