                        <p class="subtext">from old tales to living customs — explore them all.</p>
						  <ul>
							<li><b>The Wai Greeting:</b> The traditional Thai greeting, called the “wai,” involves pressing your palms
							  together in front of your chest and bowing slightly. It’s used to greet, thank, or apologize and shows
							  respect—especially to elders, monks, or superiors.</li>

							<li><b>Removing Shoes Indoors:</b> Before entering homes, temples, and even some shops, it’s customary to remove
							  your shoes. This practice reflects respect and cleanliness, as shoes are considered dirty and unfit for sacred
							  or living spaces.</li>

							<li><b>Respect for the Head and Feet:</b> In Thai culture, the head is viewed as the most sacred part of the
							  body while the feet are the lowest. Touching someone’s head or pointing your feet at others, religious icons,
							  or images of the King is considered very disrespectful.</li>

							<li><b>Polite Speech:</b> Thais often end sentences with polite particles — “krub” (for men) and “ka” (for
							  women) — to express respect and friendliness in everyday conversation.</li>

							<li><b>Temple Etiquette:</b> When visiting temples, dress modestly by covering shoulders and knees. Always
							  remove hats and shoes before entering, keep your voice low, and never point your feet toward Buddha statues.
							  Women should avoid touching monks.</li>

							<li><b>Respect for the Monarchy:</b> The Thai royal family is deeply revered. Showing disrespect toward the
							  monarchy is socially unacceptable and punishable by law. Always stand during the national anthem and avoid
							  casual discussion about the royal family.</li>

							<li><b>Maintaining Harmony and “Saving Face”:</b> Thais value calmness and avoiding confrontation. Raising your
							  voice, arguing publicly, or embarrassing someone is considered rude. Smiling and staying composed are signs of
							  maturity and respect.</li>

							<li><b>Dining Etiquette:</b> Thai meals are often shared family-style. Use a spoon to eat and a fork to push
							  food onto it — never put a fork directly in your mouth. Slurping noodles is acceptable and shows appreciation
							  for the food. Wait for the eldest person to begin eating before starting your meal.</li>

							  lanterns before letting them float away, creating one of the most visually stunning events in Thailand.</li>
							<li><b>Poi Sang Long Festival:</b> A colorful ordination ceremony for young Shan boys in Northern Thailand,
							  particularly in Mae Hong Son. The boys are dressed in ornate costumes and paraded through the streets before
							  being ordained as novice monks, marking an important rite of passage.</li>
							<li><b>Traditional Lanna Dance:</b> An iconic part of Northern Thai culture featuring graceful hand and body
							  movements. Dances such as Fon Leb (Finger Dance) and Fon Tien (Candle Dance) are performed during cultural
							  festivals, showcasing elegance and devotion through movement and symbolism.</li>
							<li><b>Hae Nang Maew (Pray for Rainfall):</b> A unique rain-making ritual where villagers parade with a cat,
							  believed to have spiritual power to bring rain. The ritual highlights Thailand’s deep agricultural traditions
							  and connection between humans, nature, and spirituality.</li>
							<li><b>Bun Bang Fai (Rocket Festival):</b> A lively and colorful event held in Yasothon province, where homemade
