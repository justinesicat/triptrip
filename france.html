                            <h3>Eiffel Tower</h3>
                                <p>The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron structure in Paris that is among the most famous landmarks in the world.
                                    It is also a technological masterpiece in building-construction history. It was designed and built (1887–89)
                                    by Gustave Eiffel and named in his honor.</p>

                                <h4>How to get there?</h4>
                                <h5>by Metro</h5>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Bir-Hakeim (Line 6): This is the closest station, offering less than a 10-minute walk to Entrance 1 of the
                                        monument.</li>
                                    <li>Trocadéro (Line 9): This station is a short walk away, about 15 minutes from the Tower.</li>
                                    <li>École Militaire (Line 8): Located approximately 11 minutes from the Eiffel Tower.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h5>by RER</h5>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel (RER C): This station provides access to the monument, with a walk of about 5 to
                                        7 minutes to Entrance 1.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h5>by Bus</h5>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Several bus lines stop near the Eiffel Tower, including lines 82, 30, 42, 69, 86, and 72, with most stops
                                        being about a 5 to 15-minute walk from the monument.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4>Best Time to Visit</h4>
                                    <p>The Eiffel Tower is never not busy, but fear not — there are times of day that are a little less hectic than
                                        others. Going all the way to the top? Expect to wait in line. Taking the stairs – all 674 of them – to the
                                        second floor is less popular, meaning shorter waits. The Eiffel Tower is at its busiest during peak season
                                        (June–September), especially on weekends. Between October and May, waiting times are shorter, especially
                                        mid-week before 10:30 AM and after 5 PM.</p>

                            <h3>Louvre Museum</h3>
                                <p>As one of the largest, oldest, and grandest museums in the world, the Louvre hosts a treasure trove of
                                    artworks spanning diverse cultures and periods of history. Marvel at the museum’s greatest hits: the Mona
                                    Lisa, the Venus de Milo, Winged Victory, and stunning collections of prized paintings and Greek and Roman
                                    statues. It’s not possible to see all of the museum in one visit, so be inspired to return for your next trip
                                    to Paris. Buy timed-entry tickets online to skip the lines as the museum is usually packed. You can also join
                                    a guided tour to enjoy a curated experience organized and led by an expert.</p>

                                <h4>Best Time to Visit</h4>
                                    <p>The Louvre is Paris’s most-visited attraction, so it pays to be clued up when it comes to how and when to
                                    visit. The museum is open from 9AM-6PM daily except Tuesdays (closed) and Fridays, when it stays open until
                                    9.45PM. You might think getting there early is the key to beating the crowds, but you’d be wrong. Morning
                                    lines can be brutal and the courtyard is usually packed with impatient tourists well before the doors open.
                                    So, if you want to dodge the dreaded Louvre queues, pitch up later in the day. Around 3PM is prime time. By
                                    now, the queues will have subsided significantly, and you’ll still have plenty of time left to ogle the art
                                    inside.</p>

						<ul>
							<li><b>Monte Carlo Motor Rally:</b> For more than 90 years, the Monte Carlo Motor Rally has been among the most
							  important rallying events in the world. Held in January, this rally is famed for its treacherous conditions,
							  with much of the route affected by snow and ice at this time of year. Taking place along the French Riviera,
							  it marks the first stage of the larger World Rally Championship.</li>

							<li><b>Cannes Film Festival:</b> Every May, the city of Cannes becomes the focal point of the world’s media as
							  it hosts the annual Cannes Film Festival. Celebrities, A-list actors, royalty, and politicians gather on the
							  French Riviera to attend exclusive premieres. While admission is invite-only, the atmosphere across Cannes is
							  electric, with glamorous off-shoot events open to the public and endless people-watching opportunities.</li>

							<li><b>Nice Carnival:</b> The largest carnival celebration in France takes place in the Mediterranean city of
							  Nice. Said to rival Rio’s Carnival, this vibrant festival occurs between February and March, lasting around
							  two weeks. It features spectacular float parades, giant sculptures, music, and the famous “Battle of the
							  Flowers,” when thousands of colorful blooms are tossed into the crowd.</li>

							<li><b>Tour de France:</b> The world’s most prestigious cycling race covers almost 3,500 kilometers and
							  showcases France’s diverse landscapes. Every July, elite cyclists race through mountains, countryside, and
							  cities, culminating in an iconic finish at the Champs-Élysées in Paris — a global sporting spectacle drawing
							  millions of viewers.</li>

							<li><b>Bastille Day:</b> France’s most important national holiday, Bastille Day celebrates the French Revolution
							  and the birth of modern France. Festivities include parades, fireworks, and parties across the nation, with
							  the largest celebration in Paris. The night before, many neighborhoods host lively street dances and communal
							  feasts that continue well past midnight.</li>
